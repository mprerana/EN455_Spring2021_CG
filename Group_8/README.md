Project description:
First we talk about the gaming craze around the people. 
Gaming is a very huge industry and there are so many varieties of game are available for mainly entertainment purpose. 
As a gamer experience, people mostly like strategic and competitive gaming. So here we focused on the type for making a learning game with interest.  We named this game as “Logic Runner”, which is a learning game In which there are so many obstacle comes in front of a gamer and he/she have to cross that by using their brain and give the right answer. 



Brief statement and novel idea of game:
Game starts from beginner level to increasing and gamer have given the information at each stage to play that level.  Once the game starts a controller started travelling automatic from the starting point and only gamer can control it by “left, Right, Jump” and crouch.
the speed of the ball will increases as increase in difficulties . This gaming idea is very new idea because this game is made by keeping the fact of the learning of the students . It helps the student to revise the concepts of science , maths , social science and English in an enjoyable manner , as the obstacles are the problems that he/she need to solve to be alive.
So for completing the level you have to give the correct answer otherwise game over.
