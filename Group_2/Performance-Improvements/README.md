#what has been Improved

###The old video had performance issues,
5 while loops for each banana. hence worse performance.
- lower frame rates 
- high CPU usage.
- laggy animation

###in the new intro, 
we use only 1 while loop to bring 60fps performance and almost 1/3rd cpu usage
- 200% framerate improvement
- 30% lesser RAM requirement
- 50% faster load time
- 100% better FPS
