# Whats inside?

- [4-D CARD DEMO](https://elasticbeanstalk-ap-south-1-187734347091.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ebsync/DOMAINS/showcase/cgproject/index.html)  Uses 2 cameras and 2 render scenes to create 4d effect. has sliders to change colors, and rotates when option is set. uses emissive materials and unreal bloom to generate the glowing effect. Nikhil has done this crazy effect.
- [Team INTRO](https://elasticbeanstalk-ap-south-1-187734347091.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ebsync/DOMAINS/showcase/cgproject/index2.html) used animation mixers with bananas to create dancing animation.  we introduce our team with this animation. watch in full screen. thanks to Nikhil for this funny intro.
- [Helmet Model With Reflections](https://elasticbeanstalk-ap-south-1-187734347091.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ebsync/DOMAINS/showcase/cgproject/Contribution-Roy/helmetReflect/helmet.html) an ultra realistic helmet model which uses gtfl loaders, which is the best object format for displaying 3d objects. we used the 3js loader with this helmet model. and created a template function so new objects can be loaded very quickly. Roy has done great work here.
- [Model Viewer example](https://elasticbeanstalk-ap-south-1-187734347091.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ebsync/DOMAINS/showcase/cgproject/Contribution-Roy/mv1/index.html) we also experimented with google's model viewer library, its ultra simple for beginners to begin with 3d using JS. Roy has demonstrated the ease of use.
- [particle physics effects](https://elasticbeanstalk-ap-south-1-187734347091.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ebsync/DOMAINS/showcase/cgproject/Contribution-Roy/raySphere/ray_demo.html) we showcase the physics engine power of 3js here, thanks to Roy's optimization of js code ,we were able to render 1000s of particles as you can see.
- [ULTIMATE SPHERE](https://elasticbeanstalk-ap-south-1-187734347091.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ebsync/DOMAINS/showcase/cgproject/Contribution-Roy/mv2/sphere.html) this sphere is the 8th wonder of world. it reflects the environment of the scene. the roughness and metallic nature can be configured in realtime. please have a look 
# Why So many demos?

its easy to over look the effort put in each effect rendered on screen, and mixing multiple effects in single demo becomes messy and redundant and not worthwhile to observe. many cooks spoil the broth. hence every major effect with 3js was coded by us separately so that every effect can be appreciated and evaluated in their own prospect.

# Whats different?
while other softwares like UNITY 3d, unreal engine have nice support. but they are paid softwares. and have stricter learning curves. and their logo is displayed with everything built with those frameworks, and dont have redistributor license. here in 3JS and model viewer, we are free to do anything, without watermarks as seen in other projects.
